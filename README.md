## SHARE-seq skin experiments

Code to repeat our experiments on the SHARE-seq mouse skin data for our manuscript "General conditional hypothesis tests suggest fundamental limits on regulatory network identification". For more info, see the [central project repo](https://github.com/ekernf01/transcriptome_knockoffs/blob/main/README.md). Anyone should be able to repeat our experiments by using the same environment we used on AWS (Ubuntu 18.04); see run_on_aws.sh for details.
